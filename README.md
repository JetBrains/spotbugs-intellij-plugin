# Reshift Security IntelliJ plugin

reshift is a lightweight security plugin for IntelliJ that quickly finds vulnerabilities, offers multiple code remediation snippets, together with rich documentation that covers detecting, fixing and testing each vulnerability.

The plugin is for developers looking to integrate security seamlessly into their software development practices. reshift is wholly focused on security, allowing Java developers to meaningfully shift left - fixing security vulnerabilities early on in their IntelliJ IDE.

*Based on SpotBugs IntelliJ plugin by Jetbrains
